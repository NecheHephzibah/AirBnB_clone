This AirBnB project is all about cloning the web application AirBnB,  an online marketplace and hospitality service platform that enables people to list, find, and rent accommodations (primarily lodging) for short-term stays.
The AirBnB clone (The Console) focuses more on the back end side of things, this is where we will be creating objects, implementing file serialisation and creating storage for our files. After this comes AirBnB clone (HTML & SQL Databases) with focus on HTML, where we created a graphical interface that users can interact with. In MySQL, a dynamic way of storing object is implemented. Then everything is taken and deployed on their servers.
You start the command interpreter by running the `base_model.py` file (for now), this helps in knowing what will work best in storage before you actaully build on the idea.
